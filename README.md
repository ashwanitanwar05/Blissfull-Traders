## ðŸš€ How to View Locally

Since the site relies on local image files referenced with relative paths, it's best to run it using a local web server to ensure all assets (especially the favicon) load correctly.

### **Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server** (Recommended)

1.  If you use **Visual Studio Code**, install the **Live Server** extension.
2.  Right-click on the `new.html` file.
3.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**.

### **Option 2: Using Python's Simple HTTP Server**

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory (where `new.html` is located).
3.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    # or python3 -m http.server
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/new.html`
